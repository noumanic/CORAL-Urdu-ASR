\chapter{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
Iteration 1 establishes a solid foundation for the CORAL project. The successful integration of multiple ASR models with confidence extraction capabilities, combined with comprehensive baseline metrics, validates the feasibility of our two-stage architecture. The significant performance gap between models and their complementary error patterns provide strong evidence that ensemble fusion with LLM-based reasoning can achieve substantial WER reduction for Urdu ASR.

The system is now ready for the critical Stage 2 implementation in Iteration 2, where we will test our core hypothesis: that instruction-guided LLM correction of confidence-weighted ensemble hypotheses can surpass individual model performance and establish a new state-of-the-art for Urdu speech recognition.
